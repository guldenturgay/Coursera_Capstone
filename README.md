## Toronto neighborhood map and neighborhood k-means cluster

The capstone_project_week_3.ipynb file is the capstone project of IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. In this project,
- [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M) was scraped for neighborhoods' postal code data.
- [Geospatial_Coordinates.csv](http://localhost:8889/edit/repos/Coursera_Capstone/Geospatial_Coordinates.csv) data was used for the locations of each postal code area.
- Toronto city folium map was created and neighborhoods were clustered and visualized on the map. 

### Notes
This project uses Foursquare private API keys to fetch data from Foursquare API. In order to fetch the data you will need to get your own Foursquare API keys and copy them into .env file __(you can rename .env.example file by removing .example part)__.
